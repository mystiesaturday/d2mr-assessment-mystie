# Mini-project: git-github | Skeleton repo

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Assessed: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Unassessed: 1

*Note: View the objectives associated with these numbers by rendering the `assessment` document or on the [course website](https://nrdowling.com/d2mr/assessment/objectives.html).*

## Description

In this project, you will create a new “skeleton” GitHub repo. The repo can either be just to practice organizing and working in GitHub or as a setup for an actual project you’re going to work on (other than your research project). 

Note: By its very nature, this mini-project cannot be contained within your `d2mr-assessment` repo. Read the submission instructions below carefully.

## Instructions

1. In the method of your choosing, create a github repo connected to an R Project. Both the repo and project should be created for this mini-project, though you can set it up planning ahead to use it as a functional repo beyond this submission.
2. In your local repository (i.e., your R Project), create a “skeleton” for the real or imagined research project. The skeleton should include all files and/or directories required for any repository and should *not* include files and/or directories that should not be stored or shared remotely. Create and organize the files and directories that may not be required in all repositories, but are either necessary or useful in this repo.
3. As you work, use git best practices for version control, including frequent, informative commit messages. In the file(s) created for the purpose of documentation, keep descriptions, file trees, and any other information up-to-date.

It you use this just for practice (vs. prepping for a real, planned project), you can make up a pretend project to structure the repo around, which does not have to be realistic. Feel free to use lorem ipsum text and other filler material for anything non-essential, or to go wild with details about your fictional project.

*Note:* If you are following the instructions as written and committing/pushing frequently, there’s a good chance you’ll come across an issue where your local and remote repos don’t seem to sync perfectly as you’d expect. If you encounter this issue, it’s your responsibility to identify what is going on and address it. While there’s always a chance you’re dealing with something actually going wrong, if you’re running into the specific thing I’m thinking about it’s actually working as intended! “Solving” the problem isn’t fixing a bug, it’s adapting your work to function the way you want it to within the system.

### Challenge suggestions

To make things trickier, show more skills, or earn engagement points, try one or more of the following:

1. Your project can be set up for a Quarto manuscript with the apaquarto extension (mirroring the final research project), but it does not have to be. Explore other options or variations, like the `papaja` package, “regular” R markdown, other Quarto extensions, or packages/publishing systems designed for other non-APA publications.
2. Your repo can be organized for something other than a research project, like an R package, github pages website, or dissertation with multiple embedded projects. Be sure that it still includes all the essential components that should be in all repos of any kind, and that the repo’s documentation clearly explains its purpose.
3. Some objectives are more straightforward to demonstrate than others. Get creative in how you show us the skills you’re practicing, but remember that your ultimate submission should just be the repository. For example, one way to meet some learning objectives is taking screenshots of the setup process, then putting them somewhere in the repo itself (sensibly organized!). 
4. Use the dummy documents in this repo to demonstrate BibTeX, notebook, and/or Quarto objectives.

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from the top level of your assessment directory into the subdirectory *of that same repo* dedicated to this mini-project — *not* the repo you have created to submit. It should be the same place that you found this README.
2. Complete the assessment document, including linking to the repository you created for this project.
3. Add Dr. Dowling and your section TA as collaborators on the repo you have created. You must do this even if the repo is public. Dr. Dowling and your TA should remain collaborators until the quarter is completed, at which point you are free to remove us and either delete or continue working in the repo.
4. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project (not the project’s repo, which you added a link to in the assessment file)
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
5. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the mini-project sub-directory you've linked to as well as your new repo, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
    1. Your grader may also may comments on or changes to your submitted repo itself, but only if there is reason to do so.
